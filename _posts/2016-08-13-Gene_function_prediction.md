We are surrounded by a hidden world of microorganisms that influence human health, have a role in food and beverage preparation, act as decomposers and have many other important functions. Modern sequencing techniques provide an insight into their genes. By knowing biological function of those genes, we can further improve our understanding of microorganisms' role in the environment. However, the function of many genes is still unknown. My primary research interest is oriented towards machine learning methods for automatic annotation of genes in microorganisms with functions.

Main research directions:
- Feature sets constructed from genomic data
- Complementarity between feature sets
- Data fusion techniques
- Development of a pipeline for automatic annotation of genes with functions
