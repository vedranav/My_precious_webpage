I'm Vedrana Vidulin, a data scientist, bioinformatician and entrepreneur in the making.

My first encounter with data science was at the BSc-level artificial intelligence and statistics courses. Fascination with data science led me to a bachelor thesis on the topic of neural networks.

I specialized data science during PhD studies at Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School, where I completed data science and artificial intelligence courses. The topic of a PhD thesis was an interactive data mining method that extracts credible knowledge from data by combining human expertise and data mining algorithms. Credible knowledge is statistically supported by data and is meaningful to the analyst.

During PhD studies, I worked at Jožef Stefan Institute. I participated in a semantic search engine project developing a method for automatic construction of a classifier that annotates web pages with genres. In the eDoorman project, I had a role of operations manager, leading a group that developed an intelligent agent mimicking behaviour of a human doorman.

At Ruđer Bošković Institute I specialized bioinformatics by learning about bioinformatic databases and pipelines, genomics and microbiology. That knowledge and my expertise in data science resulted in a bioinformatic pipeline that annotates genes in bacteria and archaea with their biological functions.

Afterwards, I received an individual fellowship to continue my work on the gene function prediction pipeline. In this period, I worked at Jožef Stefan Institute and Faculty of Information Studies and gained experience in project management, writing project proposals and teaching. I also spent four months as a research visitor at Laboratory of Computational Metagenomics at University of Trento.

My current focus is on gene function prediction and how to transfer it into practice. My mission is to develop innovative software products for microbiologists to shed light on the roles of microorganisms in human health and environment. I’m also promoting data science and bioinformatics through a blog and social networks. On top of that, I’m developing the entrepreneurial skill set needed to build a successful startup.

The results of my work are available as:
- [peer reviewed scientific papers](/publications/),
- [blog posts](/),
- [code](https://github.com/{{site.github_username}}),
- [data](/data/).

Detailed description of my achievements is presented in [curriculum vitae](http://vedranavidulin.com/assets/pdfs/CV-Vedrana_Vidulin.pdf).
